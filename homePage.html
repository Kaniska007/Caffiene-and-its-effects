    Imagine yourself, after a long workday it is night already. You are tired and you doze-off in your bed. 
    You have slept for 6 hours and you wake up as your alarm starts to ring. You reach your alarm to snooze it but, 
    it is already late and you gotta hurry for work. You did all your morning duties and hurried for work, still sleepy.
     You had your breakfast but you forgot your morning coffee in the hurry. You go to the coffee machine in your office and 
     brewed a cup of coffee yourself as the brewing staff is on leave. You return to your desk with your cup of coffee and 
     you take a sip of it and you feel much better. After finishing your work you were thinking about that better feeling 
     after that cup of coffee. Why was it so refreshing? 


  </p>
</div>
<div class="mx-5">
  <b>What causes that feeling ?</b>
  <p>
   
It was caffeine that caused the refreshing feeling. Caffeine is found in coffee beans which was in the coffee powder that you used 
to brew your coffee. Caffeine is a type of drug which is widely consumed all over the world. When you drink coffee, it goes into your 
stomach gets digested and is carried by the blood to various parts of the body. Then, when it reaches your brain and the caffeine activates your central nerve system (CNS) which is situated in the brain. The activation of CNS alerts your body and thus, feeling fresh.

It is believed that caffeine works by blocking neurotransmitter adenosine's  receptors and by increasing the excitability in the brain. 
denosine is a central nervous system neuro-modulator that has specific receptors. When adenosine binds to its receptors, neural activity
ows down and you feel sleepy. The caffeine wakes you up by fooling adenosine receptors. as adenosine slows down the nerve cell activity
 along neutral pathways, caffeine then comes and binds to the same receptor to speed the activity in those nerve cells. The increased 
 activity in nerve cells alerts you. 

Caffeine is commonly consumed to manage fatigue, headaches, drowsiness, etc. It can also improve concentration, short-term memory mental 
functioning, etc.
